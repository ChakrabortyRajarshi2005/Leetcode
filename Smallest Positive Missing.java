Difficulty: MediumAccuracy: 25.13%Submissions: 439K+Points: 4
You are given an integer array arr[]. Your task is to find the smallest positive number missing from the array.

Note: Positive number starts from 1. The array can have negative integers too.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [2, -3, 4, 1, 1, 7]
Output: 3
Explanation: Smallest positive missing number is 3.
Input: arr[] = [5, 3, 2, 5, 1]
Output: 4
Explanation: Smallest positive missing number is 4.
Input: arr[] = [-8, 0, -1, -4, -3]
Output: 1
Explanation: Smallest positive missing number is 1.
Constraints:  
1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 105
-106 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 106



class Solution {
    public int missingNumber(int[] arr) {
        int n = arr.length;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {

            // if arr[i] is within the range [1, n] and arr[i]
            // is not placed at (arr[i]-1)th index in arr
            while (arr[i] >= 1 && arr[i] <= n && arr[i] != arr[arr[i] - 1]) {

                // then swap arr[i] and arr[arr[i]-1] to
                // place arr[i] to its corresponding index
                int temp = arr[i];
                arr[i] = arr[arr[i] - 1];
                arr[temp - 1] = temp;
            }
        }

        // If any number is not at its corresponding index
        // then it is the missing number
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            if (i != arr[i - 1]) {
                return i;
            }
        }

        // If all number from 1 to n are present then n+1
        // is smallest missing number
        return n + 1;
    }
}
