Given an array of integers arr, a lucky integer is an integer that has a frequency in the array equal to its value.

Return the largest lucky integer in the array. If there is no lucky integer return -1.

 

Example 1:

Input: arr = [2,2,3,4]
Output: 2
Explanation: The only lucky number in the array is 2 because frequency[2] == 2.
Example 2:

Input: arr = [1,2,2,3,3,3]
Output: 3
Explanation: 1, 2 and 3 are all lucky numbers, return the largest of them.
Example 3:

Input: arr = [2,2,2,3,3]
Output: -1
Explanation: There are no lucky numbers in the array
class Solution {
    public int findLucky(int[] arr) {
        HashMap<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();

        for (int n : arr) {
            map.put(n, map.getOrDefault(n, 0) + 1);
        }

        int luckyInteger = -1;

        for (int key : map.keySet()) {
            if (map.get(key) == key) {
                luckyInteger = key; 
            }
        }
        return luckyInteger;  
    }
}
